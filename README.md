# Amfora in Docker

Harness the power of Gemini and fuse it into whales so you can run the excellent [Amfora](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora) in a Docker container.

## Usage

``` shell
docker run -it thejf/amfora
```

## Why?

Saves me from installing things other than Docker on a machine. Probably not the best way to run it though.
